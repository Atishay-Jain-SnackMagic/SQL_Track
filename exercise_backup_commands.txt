Here are the commands I used to create this backup database and restore it

To backup database

pg_dump -U postgres -W -F  p exercise_3 > exercise_3_backup.sql

To restore database

psql -U ubuntu -d restored -f exercise_3_backup.sql

Here, I have used psql instead of pg_restore because the type of file is a plain text file. If it would be a .dump file, I would use pg_restore in that case.
